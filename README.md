# Test for Entry Fullstack JS - 23people
#### By Ricardo Riveros Rivera.

This basic calculator app will be built on ReactJS, having the 4 basic arithmetical operations: +,-,/,* and the util buttons (clear, equals, point, remove). The librarys for Node.js that will be used on this project are:
```
- ESLint (Verify structure of code and possible bugs).
- MathJS (For arithmetical operations on the logic part of the app).
- gh-pages (Deploy the app on github's pages for it's review).
```
All the code related to the component is inside the "Calculator" directory.
Thanks for giving me the chance to do the test :).
